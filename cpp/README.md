# C++ Tutorial by noncreature0714

This unpretentious tutorial is a growing tutorial, meant to stay up-to-date with modern C++ language specification and is meant to be accessible to a broad audience.

A few guidelines I follow:

 1. Never assumes prior knowledge
 2. Clarity over brevity
 3. Simplicity over complexity
 4. Silence over misinformation
 5. Natural langauge over "shop talk"
 6. "shop talk" is explained

Meaning, I will always explain something as if this is the first time you are seeing it, every time. I won't ramble, but will be illustrative or incorporate proven educational methods; so there may be "extra" words, sometimes. Complex ideas will be explained in the simplest terms, or not at all. Information stated will be accurate, or not included (where I lack knowledge). I will stray away from technical garble, but will always make sure it is available.
