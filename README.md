# Tutorials by Noncreature0714

This unpretentious tutorial is a growing tutorial, meant to stay up-to-date with modern specification and good practice, and is meant to be accessible to a broad audience.

A few guidelines I follow:

 1. Never assumes prior knowledge
 2. Clarity over brevity
 3. Simplicity over complexity
 4. Silence over misinformation
 5. Natural langauge over "shop talk"
 6. "shop talk" is explained

Meaning, I will always explain something as if this is the first time you are seeing it, every time. I won't ramble, but will be illustrative or incorporate proven educational methods; so there may be "extra" words, sometimes. Complex ideas will be explained in the simplest terms, or not at all. Information stated will be accurate, or not included (where I lack knowledge). I will stray away from technical garble, but will always make sure it is available.

What are my guiding questions/inspirations? Firstly, I didn't find the development community to be very welcoming or informative, especially as a non-traditional entrant into the field. I also genuinely believe the world is a better place when information is not only available, but clear and useful. This guide is an attempt to make the world a better place by removing barriers, percieved or otherwise. I have a personal aversion to poor design, and find many tutorials poorly designed or needing extra knowledge (or money). *So this tutorial is designed for offline use!* It includes software needed to run the code, so can be downloaded and used in non-optimal places in the world (so long as there is a computer and power).
